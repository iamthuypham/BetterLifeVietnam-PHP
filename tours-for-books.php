			<h4>Train ticket booking</h4>
			Despite taking a longer time in comparison with other forms of transportation, traveling by train is still among popular choices with tourists coming to Vietnam, as you can fully enjoy the panorama view of the landscapes at ground level, and have a real insight of both urban & rural areas in the country.<br /><br />
			As our tours cover a wide range of destinations: from Sapa - the beautiful hill station - the highlighted spot of the North, to Hue, Danang, Ho Chi Minh city - the gorgeous parts of the South bound; <b>Tours For Books</b> has cooperated with lot of trustworthy agents to provide train ticket with best price guarantee. Our tour consultants will help you with the comprehensive services, so you will no longer worry about cheating or time wasting waiting on a long queue to buy ticket.<br /><br />
			<h4>Air ticket booking</h4>
			If you have time limitation when traveling in Vietnam, travel by air might be an ideal domestic option. Almost all routes just take about a maximum 2-hour flight, and with high frequency per day. Recently, many new domestic routes have been added and the service has been improved drastically, thus more and more tourists opt for air travel in Vietnam.<br /><br />
			<b>Tours For Books</b> has been working closely with plenty of prestigious ticket reservation offices of the major airlines in Vietnam such as Vietnam Airlines, VietjetAir, JetStar etc.; therefore when you book air ticket with us, we can guarantee about the good fare for early-birds, the quick information & solution in case there is any change in your flight booking, and the time consuming & cost saving you will have.<br /><br />
			<h4>Car for rent</h4>
			The problem with International Driving License is still not finalized in Vietnam, thus drive a car on your own is not really a good choice here. Especially when you travel with your family or a group of more than 5 people, it will cost you a lot more than you expect.<br /><br />
			That's a reason why <b>Tours For Books</b> offers car rental service with driver. With the extensive routes to many famous destinations in Vietnam, you can either relax and enjoy the surpassing sceneries on the way or save your time and money. Following our motto "drive safe, drive fun", our highly trained drivers - with not only good English speaking & skilled driving but also friendly and courteous - along with a wide range of high-standard vehicles including 4-seater car, 16-seater van, 24-seater bus, 35-seater bus & 45-seater bus will provide you with an unforgettable driving experience.<br /><br />
