		<p>Better education is a vital social need.  In developed countries, the children can enjoy free education. They don't have to pay to go to primary school, secondary school and high school; they can have free textbooks and other school's materials.<br /><br />
		In developing countries the economy is frequently not strong enough to provide free education for their children. Families have to pay. They also have to buy textbooks, uniforms and other educational materials themselves. In Vietnam, school fees range from VND 360,000 (US&#36;19) per year for pupils who live in rural and mountainous areas, to VND 1,800,000 for pupils who live in big cities. Those costs are nothing to rich families, and little trouble to normal families who live in big cities or central provinces. But those costs are really a big burden to families who live in rural and mountainous areas, because their average income is only 20,000 VND (US&#36;1) per day (or even less).<br /><br />
		Better Life Vietnam works really hard to address this problem and help to reduce the burden for the poor families of Vietnam.
