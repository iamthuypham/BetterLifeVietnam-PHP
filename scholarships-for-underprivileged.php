		<p>Poverty prevents many Vietnamese children, even children who dedicate 
themselves to study and other worthwhile activities, from continuing their education beyond primary school. In Vietnam, there are far too many examples of children having to stop going to school in order to earn a living. There are also students who work so hard to pass a very competitive national entrance exam into universities, but then cannot finance their university studies.
<br /><br />
		The BLV scholarship program was designed to give qualified children, who study well at school, the extra push by providing partial financial support to help them continue going to school. A variety of scholarship packages with a value of from $25 per month to $80 per month will be a significant help for underprivileged pupils or students to continue with their studies. The amounts indicated will cover school fees, study materials and living expenses for one student for one month. Our dream is to expand our small beginnings and, through the support of donors, make significant changes in the lives of increasing numbers of worthy but struggling young people.
		</p>

		<h3>Scholarship packages</h3>
		Primary school scholarship: worth US&#36;25 per month, targeting at needy primary school children from ages 6- 10, whose promise deserves our support.<br /><br />
 
		Secondary school scholarship: worth US&#36;35 per month, targeting similar secondary school children from ages 11-14.<br /><br />
 
		High school scholarship: worth US&#36;50 per month, for needy and able high school children from ages 15- 18.<br /><br />
 
		University scholarship: worth US&#36;80 per month, for university students who have passed the entrance exam into universities but lack the finance to begin studying.

		<h3>How it works</h3>
		BLV will choose from the pool of needy children from the program <a target="_blank" href="http://caplayeuthuong.vtv24.vtv.vn/"><i>Cap L&aacute; Y&ecirc;u Thuong</i></a>. This is a charity program launched by <a target="_blank" href="http://english.vtv.vn/about-us.htm">Vietnam Television(VTV24)</a> in coordination with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.molisa.gov.vn/en/Pages/Detail-news.aspx?IDNews=2252">Ministry of Labor, Invalid and Social Affairs</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://vbsp.org.vn/">Vietnam Bank for Social Policies</a>. This program aims at connecting sponsors with children in need. Our aim is to do this. BLV will create a list of good school performers in the needy category. We believe that if we offer these children our help at the right time, they will be able to take off.<br /><br />
 
		We shall provide sponsors with lists of the chosen children. You can offer your help by choosing a child in the list with a scholarship package. This may be a monthly donation or a fixed amount. Your help by sponsoring a child in a long term will be gratefully received by BLV and will certainly change a young life. Any amount, however, will be support we gratefully welcome.<br /><br />
 
		If you are interested in sponsoring a child or student from our lists, you need simply to email your selection to us. We will then enable you to send your donation directly to the bank account of <a target="_blank" href="http://caplayeuthuong.vtv24.vtv.vn/"><i>Cap L&aacute; Y&ecirc;u Thuong</i></a> at the Vietnam Bank for Social Policies. The Vietnam Bank for Social Policies will then be responsible for handling the scholarship to the child of your choice monthly.

		<h3>How do we monitor and evaluate this program?</h3>
		In addition to selecting appropriate school and university students, BLV will play a role in making sure your donation is sent to the children and checking their study progress. We will also contact the recipient's family regularly, monitor performance, and by the end of each semester organize letters where possible from the young person you support. A visit to the study location can also be organized if you wish.<br /><br />
 
		Only children who have good grades by the end of each semester will be eligible for a scholarship by next semester.

		Below is the list of bright students who need your support:<br /><br />

			<h4>1. Doan Huu Danh (14 years old, Ben Tre)</h4>

			<p>Danh is a 14 year old boy without a father from the time he was born. He has been cared for by his mother and grandmother who have no stable job. Although he also has to work to support the family, he still studies well at school. He wishes to finish his high school and to be able to go to university. He will enter high school next year and will be eligible for a high school scholarship package of $50 per month.</p>

			<h4 style="margin-top:30px">3. Le Thi Thu Ngan (16 years old, Khanh Hoa)</h4>

			<a target="_blank"  href="http://caplayeuthuong.vtv24.vtv.vn/nguoi-me-ngheo-dau-yeu-gang-suc-nuoi-ba-con-an-hoc/a242.html">http://caplayeuthuong.vtv24.vtv.vn/nguoi-me-ngheo-dau-yeu-gang-suc-nuoi-ba-con-an-hoc/a242.html</a>
			<p>Ngan is one of a family of three children. Her father left the family when she was a child and her mother has suffered from a serious uterine illness. Despite having this serious disease, her mother has been working hard to raise Ngan and her sister and brother. Her mother's job as a dish washer brings the family an income of less than VND2,000,000 per month (less than $90). This puts Ngan, her brother and her sister at risk of having to quit school. We hope to offer Ngan a high scholarship package of $50 per month.</p>

			Son is one of a family of three children. His father left the family when she was a child and his mother has suffered from a serious uterine illness.

My and her grandparents are dependent on a government allowance of VND800,000 VND per month ($35). We hope to offer My a primary scholarship package of $25 per month for her to be able to have healthy meals and go to school.</p>
